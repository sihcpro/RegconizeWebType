I wrote this project by **python3**. So you sould you **python3** to run this.
I suggest you should use virtualenvwrapper:

See [virtualenvwrapper_python]
(https://python-guide-cn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs.html)
or [virtualenvwrapper]
(https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

When make an virtualenv, you should try:

    mkvirtualenv [name] -p python3

It 'll automatic make default python = python3


First: install environment by this command:

    pip install -r requirement.txt

Second: run it :D

That's all
